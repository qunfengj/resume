I’m Qunfeng Jiang 江群峰, an undergraduate at the Dept. of Physics, Fudan University, Shanghai. I’m also a SURF student at Caltech in the 2022 summer with a project on the inner accretion flows of a black hole.

My research interests include high-energy astrophysics, X-ray astronomy, and the behavior of black holes.
